# ArkUI-X Security and Disclosure Statement

## Security Bulletins

You can obtain ArkUI-X security bulletins and disclosure information from [ArkUI-X Security Bulletins](../security-disclosure/readme.md).

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

We thank all security researchers and users who report security vulnerabilities to the ArkUI-X open-source community. The community conducts a comprehensive investigation on the security vulnerabilities you report.

### Internal Reporting

If a bug in the SIG is confirmed as a security vulnerability, the community will change the corresponding issue to a private issue, add the security issue label, and add the priority label as needed. The community Security Issue Response Team (referred to as Team hereinafter) will periodically check the updates of such issues.

### External Reporting

If a security vulnerability is not on the list of public security vulnerabilities that the Team has handled, you can report the security vulnerability via either of the following:

- Email 

  Please immediately send an email to scy@arkui-x.cn so that the Team can start the patch, release, and announcement processes. After receiving the email, the Team will create a security issue in the community. 

  [Email template](./template-security-bug.md).

- Community issue 

  You can create an issue in the community where the issue is found, and mark the issue as a **security issue**. When creating the issue, select the **private issue** type.

If necessary, the Team will ask whether you can disclose this issue secretly through the person in charge. If you object, we will disclose the issue publicly.

### When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

- You believe that you have discovered potential security vulnerabilities in ArkUI-X.
- You are not sure how the vulnerabilities may affect ArkUI-X.
- You have discovered vulnerabilities that ArkUI-X depends on in other projects. You can attach the link that has been reported to the upstream community.


### When Shouldn't I Report Vulnerabilities?

- You want to help improve the security capability of ArkUI-X.
- You need security-related help.
- Your issues are irrelevant to security.


## Security Vulnerability Response

- The ArkUI-X Team will confirm and analyze reported security issues within three working days and start handling the issues.

- After confirming security issues, the Team distributes and follows up the issues.
- In the process of classifying, identifying, fixing, and releasing security issues, we will send you the handling progress report through emails in a timely manner. 


## Vulnerability Disclosure

- The date of public disclosure is determined by the Team and the security issue submitter. For security issues, once mitigation or workarounds are available, the vulnerabilities will be disclosed as soon as possible.
- Delayed disclosure is inevitable and reasonable when security issues are not fully understood and corrected, the solution is not fully tested, or coordination with the distributors is not completed.
- We usually disclose the vulnerabilities on the Tuesday of the first full week of each month.
- The Team has the final decision on the date of disclosure.
