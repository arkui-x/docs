# Application Development Overview

The application development documents provide reference for you to develop cross-platform applications using the APIs provided by ArkUI-X. They walk you through how to use JS APIs to develop applications that run across the Anroid, iOS, and OpenHarmony platforms.

The documents are carefully organized as follows:

## Getting Started

[Here](quick-start/README.md) you'll learn how to quickly get started with cross-platform application development.

Browse the documents on the instructions for quickly building your first application and the basics about OpenHarmony applications.

Check out the development fundamentals, which comprise descriptions of the package structure configuration file for cross-platform applications, the instructions for use of resource files, and guides to ArkUI-X Command Line Tools.

## Tools

[ACE Tools](quick-start/start-with-ace-tools.md) is the default toolchain for cross-platform application development.
It can be used to create, build, install, run, debug, and install cross-platform applications. For details, see [ACE Tools](https://gitee.com/arkui-x/cli/blob/master/README-EN.md).

## Samples

To make you better understand how functions work together and jumpstart your application development projects, we provide stripped-down, real-world [samples](https://gitee.com/arkui-x/samples). These samples can be directly run through ArkUI-X Command Line Tools.

## API References

The API references encompass the components and APIs available in ArkUI-X, helping you use and integrate APIs more effectively.

They are organized as follows:

- [Component Reference (ArkTS-based Declarative Development Paradigm)](reference/arkui-ts/README.md)
- [API Reference (ArkTS and JS APIs)](reference/apis/README.md)
- [API Reference (Native API)](reference/native-apis/README.md)
- Platform Integration
  - [Android](reference/arkui-for-android/README.md)
  - [iOS](reference/arkui-for-ios/README.md)
