# Introduction to Dynamic Features

## Overview

With ArkUI-X dynamic features, you can dynamically deliver cross-platform content on demand, decoupling it from the host application. Below are the two typical use cases of the nimble dynamic features:

1. Dynamic framework: The ArkUI cross-platform development framework can be downloaded and installed separately from the cloud, which means that you can reduce the initial download size of your application.

2. Dynamic features: Features developed in ArkTS can be decoupled from host applications, and independently delivered and upgraded on demand.

>**NOTE**
>
>When using the dynamic features, make sure your application complies with the release rules of the target application distribution platform. Any rule violation may result in your application being removed from the platform, a risk to be borne by the developer.
