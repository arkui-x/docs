# Before You Start

This document is intended for novices at ArkUI cross-platform application development. It helps you get started with the ArkUI cross-platform application development process as well as the main files in the project directory, by walking you through creating a simple HelloWorld application.

Before you start, you need to understand the basic concepts about the ArkUI framework and the ArkUI-X project.

## Basic Concepts

### ArkUI

ArkUI is a declarative UI development framework for building distributed applications. It provides simple and natural UI syntax, diverse array of UI components, multi-dimensional status management, and real-time UI preview tools, helping you improve application development efficiency and achieve vivid and smooth user experience across devices.

### ArkUI-X

The ArkUI-X project further extends the ArkUI framework to multiple OS platforms. Currently, it supports OpenHarmony, Android, and iOS. More OS platforms will be supported in the future. The ArkUI-X project allows you to develop high-performance applications supporting multiple platforms by using a set of main code.


## Preparations

1. [Download the latest version of ArkUI-X Command Line Tools](https://gitee.com/arkui-x/cli/repository/archive/master.zip).

2. Set up the development environment by following instructions in [Installing the Environment](https://gitee.com/arkui-x/cli/blob/master/README.md#installing-the-environment).

Now you are ready for ArkUI-X application development. Follow the instructions in [Creating an Application](https://gitee.com/arkui-x/cli/blob/master/README-EN.md#creating-an-application), [Building the Project](https://gitee.com/arkui-x/cli/blob/master/README-EN.md#building-the-project), and [Getting Started with ArkTS in FA Model](quick-start/start-with-ets-fa.md).
