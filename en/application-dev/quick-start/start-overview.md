# Before You Start

This document is intended for novices at ArkUI cross-platform application development. It helps you get started with the ArkUI cross-platform application development process as well as the main files in the project directory, by walking you through creating a simple HelloWorld application.

Before you start, you need to understand the basic concepts about the ArkUI framework and the ArkUI-X project.

## Basic Concepts

### ArkUI

ArkUI is a declarative UI development framework for building distributed applications. It provides simple and natural UI syntax, diverse array of UI components, multi-dimensional status management, and real-time UI preview tools, helping you improve application development efficiency and achieve vivid and smooth user experience across devices.

### ArkUI-X

The ArkUI-X project further extends the ArkUI framework to multiple OS platforms. Currently, it supports OpenHarmony, Android, and iOS. More OS platforms will be supported in the future. The ArkUI-X project allows you to develop high-performance applications supporting multiple platforms by using a set of main code.


## Preparations

1. [Download the latest version of ACE Tools](https://gitee.com/arkui-x/cli/repository/archive/master.zip).

2. Set up the development environment by following instructions in [Installing the Environment](./start-with-ace-tools.md#installing-the-environment) and [Installing Dependencies](./start-with-ace-tools.md#installing-dependencies).

3. Learn how to download and use the ArkUI-X SDKs.
