# ArkUI-X SDK

ArkUI-X extends the OpenHarmony ArkUI development framework to different OS platforms like Android and iOS. This way, you can reuse most of the application code (UI and main application logic) based on ArkUI and deploy the code on your OS.

The ArkUI SDK contains the engine library, plug-in library, and command line tool used to develop ArkUI-X applications. For details about how to obtain the ArkUI-X SDK, see [Acquiring SDK from Mirrors](../../release-notes/ArkUI-X-v1.0.0-canary1.md#acquiring-sdk-from-mirrors).

## ArkUI-X SDK Components

The ArkUI-X SDK provides the basic engine library, plug-in library, toolchain, and SDK configuration description files. When DevEco Studio or ACE Tools is used, configure the ArkUI-X SDK based on the following directory structure.

```
Path-to-arkui-x-sdk

## ArkUI-X Command Line Tool

[ACE Tools](../quick-start/start-with-ace-tools.md) is a command line tool provided for ArkUI-X application developers. You can use it to check the development environment check, create a project, build an application, and install, run, and debug your application.
