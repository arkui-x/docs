## 19030002 Certificate Signature Verification Failed

**Error Message**

The certificate signature verification failed.

**Possible Causes**

Incorrect certificate signature information is found during the signature verification.

**Solution**

Check whether the certificate is correct.

## 19030003 Certificate Has Not Taken Effect

**Error Message**

The certificate has not taken effect.

**Possible Causes**

The certificate has not taken effect. The effective time of the certificate is later than the current system time or the time specified by the service.

**Solution**

1. Check whether the certificate is correct.
2. Check whether the system time is correct.

## 19030004 Certificate Expired

**Error Message**

The certificate has expired.

**Possible Causes**

The certificate has expired. The certificate expiration time is earlier than the current system time or the time specified by the service.

**Solution**

1. Check whether the certificate is correct.
2. Check whether the system time is correct.
3. Compare the certificate expiration time with the current system time to determine whether the certificate has expired.

## 19030005 Failed to Obtain the Certificate Issuer
