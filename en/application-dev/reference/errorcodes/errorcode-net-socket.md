**Description of TCP/UDP error codes:**
> Mapping format of other TCP/UDP Socket error codes: 2301000 + Linux kernel error code (errno). For details, see Linux kernel error codes.

## 2300002 System Internal Error

**Error Message**

System internal error.

**Description**

This error code is reported if a system internal error occurs.

**Cause**

1. The memory is abnormal.

2. A null pointer is present.

**Procedure**

1. Check whether the memory space is sufficient. If not, clear the memory and try again.

2. Check whether the system is normal. If not, try again later or restart the device.

## 2303104 System Call Interrupted

**Error Message**

Interrupted system call.

**Description**

This error code is reported if the system call is interrupted.

**Cause**

Calling the **connect** function may result in a long blocking time. In such a case, the system generates an interrupt signal and returns an **EINTR** error.

**Procedure**

Call the **connect** function to try network connection again.

## 2303109 Error File Number

**Error Message**

Bad file number.

**Description**

This error code is reported if an operation is performed on a locally closed socket.

**Cause**

The socket FD may be closed.

**Procedure**

Check whether the socket is closed unexpectedly.

## 2303111 Requested Resource Temporarily Unavailable

**Error Message**

Resource temporarily unavailable try again.

**Description**

This error code is reported if the requested system resource is temporarily unavailable.

**Cause**

The system resources are in use.

**Procedure**

Try again later.

## 2303188 Socket Operations on Non-Sockets

**Error Message**

Socket operation on non-socket.

**Description**

This error code is reported if a socket descriptor is not specified for the **socket** parameter.

**Cause**

A socket descriptor is not specified for the **socket** parameter.

**Procedure**

Check whether the descriptor is correctly obtained.

## 2303191 Incorrect Socket Protocol Type

**Error Message**

Protocol wrong type for socket.

**Description**

This error code is reported if the type of the specified socket protocol is incorrect.

**Cause**

The **socket** function is called with an unsupported socket protocol type.
For example, the protocol type cannot be set to **SOCK_STREAM socket** for the the Internet UDP protocol.

**Procedure**

Check whether the socket protocol type is correct.

## 2303198 Network Address Already In Use

**Error Message**

Address already in use.

**Description**

This error code is reported if a network address has been used.

**Cause**

The probable cause can be any of the following: The application attempts to bind a socket to an IP address/port that has been used for an existing socket. The socket is not properly closed. The socket is still being closed.

**Procedure**

Try another network address.

## 2303199 Failed to Assign the Requested Address

**Error Message**

Cannot assign requested address.

**Description**

This error code is reported if the requested address is invalid in its context.

**Cause**

The remote address or port is invalid for the remote server.

**Procedure**

Check whether the address or port is correct.

## 2303210 Connection Timeout

**Error Message**

Connection timed out.

**Description**

This error code is reported if the connection to the remote server cannot be set up for a long time.

**Cause**

It is probable that a server breakdown has occurred.

**Procedure**

Contact the peer end to rectify the fault.

## 2303501 Null SSL

**Error Message**

SSL is null.

**Description**

This error code is reported if the SSL is null.

**Cause**

The returned error information is null when an internal function fails to be executed.

**Procedure**

Call the function again.

## 2303502 TLS Reading Error

**Error Message**

Error in tls reading.

**Description**

This error code is reported if an error occurs while reading data on the TLS socket.

**Cause**

The underlying socket is blocked.

**Procedure**

Perform data receiving again.

## 2303503 TLS Writing Error

**Error Message**

Error in tls writing.

**Description**

This error code is reported if an error occurs while writing data on the TLS socket.

**Cause**

When the send buffer is full, the underlying socket sends an **EWOUDLBLOCK** error, which means that the server does not read the data sent from the client.

**Procedure**

Rectify the fault on the server side.

## 2303504 x509 Failed to Look Up the x509 Certificate

**Error Message**

Error looking up x509.
