# Contributor Agreement and License Compliance Guide

## Purpose

This document specifies the contributor agreement and license compliance guide for the ArkUI-X project. It covers the following parts:

**(1) Developer Certificate of Origin**

**(2) Code Contribution License**

**(3) Document Contribution License**

**(4) Third-Party Open-Source Software Licenses**

## Scope

This document applies only to the ArkUI-X community. It is not applicable to the scenario where the ArkUI-X project is used by individuals or enterprises to develop their products or the scenario where third-party open-source software is distributed. For details, see [Introducing Third-Party Open-Source Software](introducing-third-party-open-source-software.md).

**(1) Developer Certificate of Origin**

You must sign the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) before you can contribute to the community.

The DCO is a statement of originality and contribution of your work. The DCO to sign is fully quoted from the [standard DCO version](https://developercertificate.org/) released by the Linux Foundation.

Before contributing to the community, you must obtain the [signing-dco.md](signing-dco.md) file, sign it, and send the signed file to [contact@mail.arkui-x.cn](mailto:contact@mail.arkui-x.cn). Then you can include the Signed-off-by information for each commit. (The online mode for signing the DCO will be provided later.)

**(2) Code Contribution License**

In principle, for every code contribution, source code licensed under the Apache License 2.0 (Apache-2.0) must be provided. For details about Apache-2.0, visit [the website](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).

**(3) Document Contribution License**

In principle, for every document contribution, documents shall be licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (CC BY 4.0). For details about CC BY 4.0, visit [the website](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

**(4) Third-Party Open-Source Software Licenses**

To facilitate the maintenance and evolution of third-party open-source software, consider the following license-related factors when introducing them:

**Free redistribution**. Third-party dependencies that do not support redistribution will not be accepted.

**License compatibility**: If a third-party dependency may be merged or mixed with other code of the ArkUI-X project, but the license on which the third-party dependency depends is incompatible with the license of the mixed or merged code, the third-party dependency will not be accepted.

**Fulfillability of license obligations**: If the license on which a third-party dependency depends contains obligations that cannot be fulfilled or are difficult to fulfill, such as advertising clauses and beer clauses, the third-party dependency will not be accepted.

**Reasonability of license restrictions or constraints**: If the license on which a third-party dependency depends contain unreasonable restrictions or constraints, such as commercial restrictions, application domain restrictions, discrimination against special technical domains, or product-specific restrictions, the third-party dependency will not be accepted.

If the license on which a third-party dependency depends explicitly excludes patent authorization, for example, CC0 license, it is not recommended that the third-party dependency be accepted if there are other options.

Third-party dependencies using weak copyleft licenses can be accepted if they can ensure that the obligations of the weak infectious licenses are fulfilled and certain isolation measures are taken in the reference mode.

**Licenses for Acceptable Third-Party Dependencies**

In principle, third-party dependencies using licenses whose license terms are equivalent to Apache-2.0 and whose open-source license obligations can be fulfilled without obstacles can be accepted. The PMC approves third-party dependencies using the following licenses:
