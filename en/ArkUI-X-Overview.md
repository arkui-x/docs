# ArkUI-X Project

## Introduction

ArkUI is a declarative UI development framework for building distributed applications. It provides simple and natural UI syntax, diverse array of UI components, multi-dimensional status management, and real-time UI preview tools, helping you improve application development efficiency and achieve vivid and smooth user experience across devices.

The ArkUI-X project further extends the ArkUI framework to multiple OS platforms. Currently, it supports OpenHarmony, Android, and iOS. More OS platforms will be supported in the future. The ArkUI-X project allows you to develop high-performance applications supporting multiple platforms by using a set of main code.

## Key Characteristics

ArKUI-X shines in the following key characteristics:

1. Simple and natural declarative syntax
2. Efficient rendering pipeline and platform-specific rendering mechanism
3. High-performance ArkCompiler and runtime
4. Unified cross-platform API capability set and extension mechanism
