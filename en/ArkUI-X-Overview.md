# ArkUI-X Overview

## Introduction

ArkUI is a declarative UI development framework for building distributed applications. It provides simple and natural UI syntax, diverse UI components, multi-dimensional status management, and real-time UI preview capabilities, helping you improve application development efficiency and achieve vivid and smooth user experience across devices. For details, see [ArkUI Overview](https://gitcode.com/openharmony/docs/blob/master/en/application-dev/ui/arkui-overview.md).

ArkUI-X further extends the ArkUI framework to multiple OS platforms. Currently, it supports OpenHarmony, HarmonyOS, Android, and iOS. More OS platforms will be supported in the future. With ArkUI-X, you can use a set of main code to develop high-performance applications supporting multiple platforms.
